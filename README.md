# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Create a `.env` file locally to run the scripts!
- `ETH_GOERLI_INFURA_URL`
- `ETH_GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `ETH_MAINNET_INFURA_URL`
- `ETH_MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY`

And run commands like:
- `npx hardhat run scripts/get_balance.ts --network eth_goerli`
- `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost`

For scripts using local hardhat blockchain, make sure you launch `npx hardhat node`
